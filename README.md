# Temperature tracker for Arduino using ThingSpeak


This project was created so I could know my home temperature just checking my phone, to be sure it wasn't too hot for my cat when she was home alone in a heat wave.

User must replace Local Network settings and ThingSpeak settings (APIKey) with their own. 

Temperature is displayed in Celsius.
